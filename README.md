# Birthday Paradox and Data Analysis on James Joyce's *Ulysses*
For this assignment, we wrote a module that helped us model the famous "birthday paradox" (wherein the probability of collisions of birthdates
among a group of people is higher than intuition would suggest).

Additionally, we were asked to do some basic analysis on a book of our choice - I chose to look at the average word lengths of the 
infamously esoteric *Ulysses*.
